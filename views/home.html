            <hr>
                <p>We are looking for a dedicated learner who is willing to take on tasks without hesitation.
                You must be able to work in a team environment and be willing to come into the office.</p><br>

            <h2 class="center">More about Us</h2>
            <hr>
            <p> Our mission is to accelerate EV adoption by providing the infrastructure and services that make it easy to go electric.
                While other companies set goals for 2030, we’re focused on change we can make today. We’re also focused on cities,
                which have the biggest barriers to EV adoption but the most potential for change.<br><br>

                <b>Our Operating Principles</b>

              <br><b>Empathy.</b> We seek to understand the experiences and perspectives of each other, our customers and the communities where we operate.

                <br><b>Ownership.</b> We are excited by big challenges and care deeply about our work. We empower and rely on each other and hold ourselves to a high standard.

                <br><b>Humility.</b> We take our work seriously but not ourselves. We’re approachable, curious, and know we have a lot to learn.

                <br><b>Adaptability.</b> We expect change and quickly adjust our approach to reflect new information. We know success requires seeing opportunity in obstacles and relentlessly improving.

                <br><b> Simplicity.</b> We clarify and prioritize what can be done now. We strive to keep things no more complicated than absolutely required.
